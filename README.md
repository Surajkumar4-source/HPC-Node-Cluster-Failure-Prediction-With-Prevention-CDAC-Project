# **Project Title:**  **HPC Node/Cluster Failure Prediction Using Logs and Monitoring Metrics**  

## **Key Objectives**  
1. **Proactive Maintenance** – Identify potential failures before they occur to minimize downtime.  
2. **Log Analysis** – Utilize historical log data to detect patterns that precede node or cluster failures.  
3. **Real-Time Monitoring** – Incorporate system metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and disk health.  
4. **Machine Learning-Based Prediction** – Develop models to classify or predict failure probabilities using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## **Project Workflow**  

### **1. Data Collection**  
- **Log Files** – Collect system logs from sources like syslog, application logs, and HPC scheduler logs (e.g., SLURM, PBS).  
- **Monitoring Metrics** – Capture CPU temperature, memory usage, I/O errors, network latency, disk usage, etc.  
- **Failure Events** – Annotate logs with recorded failures, such as hardware malfunctions or job crashes.  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Log Parsing** – Extract meaningful data using tools like Logstash, Fluentd, or Python libraries (e.g., loguru).  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Count error occurrences (e.g., I/O errors, kernel panics).  
  - Identify resource usage trends and anomalies.  
  - Handle missing, noisy, or redundant data.  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Identify correlations and patterns in system failures.  
- Visualize trends in log frequency, CPU/GPU failures, and resource usage.  
- **Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Grafana, Kibana.  

### **4. Model Development**  
#### **Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised Learning)**  
- **Goal:** Detect unusual system behavior before failure occurs.  
- **Algorithms:** Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, PCA.  

#### **Predictive Modeling (Supervised Learning)**  
- **Goal:** Predict failures based on historical patterns.  
- **Algorithms:**  
  - **Traditional ML:** Random Forest, XGBoost.  
  - **Deep Learning (Optional):** LSTM for sequential log data, RNNs or Transformers for time-series analysis.  

### **5. Deployment**  
- **Real-Time Monitoring** – Integrate predictive models with monitoring tools like Prometheus or Nagios.  
- **Automated Alerts** – Notify system administrators via email, Slack, or PagerDuty when failure probabilities exceed thresholds.  
- **Tools:** Docker (containerization), Kubernetes (scalability).  

### **6. Validation & Performance Evaluation**  
- Test the model on recent, unseen log data.  
- Evaluate performance using **Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC**.
